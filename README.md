## Overview

This is **not** a component dump. It is a disciplined pipeline that turns a Figma design into production React code with no drift:

- **Tokens are synced 1:1 from Figma.** Every color, radius, font, and shadow in `app/globals.css` is the *exact* output of the Figma kit `design-lazyyy-figma-uikit-pro` (collection `shadcn/ui`). Code renders byte-identical to the source.
- **Components are installed on demand.** Per shadcn/ui's philosophy, components live in your repo as source — added via the CLI when a design needs them, never pre-bundled.
- **An agent skill enforces fidelity.** `.claude/skills/shadcn-ui-tailwind-figma/SKILL.md` auto-loads in Claude Code (and other Agent-Skill tools) and applies a strict contract: **nothing added, nothing dropped, nothing inferred, nothing "polished."**
- **The design system is documented.** [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) is the single source of truth — a complete, official-grade token reference kept in lockstep with `globals.css` and the Figma kit.

> **Mental model:** Figma is the source of design intent *and* token values. Code mirrors it. The starter exists to make that mirroring automatic and tamper-evident.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) · React 19 | RSC by default — add `"use client"` for interactivity |
| Language | TypeScript 5 | Strict mode |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 | `@theme inline` in `globals.css`; no config file |
| Components | shadcn/ui (CLI-driven) | Radix **or** Base UI — check `npx shadcn@latest info` |
| Tokens | Figma-kit-synced (sRGB) | `design-lazyyy-figma-uikit-pro` → `shadcn/ui` collection |
| Fonts | Data-driven from Figma `family/*` | This kit: Inter (sans) · Geist Mono (mono) |
| Icons | lucide | Don't add other icon packs unless the design needs them |
| Design ↔ Code | Figma Dev Mode MCP | `get_design_context` / `get_screenshot` / `get_variable_defs` |

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18.18+** (20 LTS recommended) and npm / pnpm / bun
- A **Figma Dev Mode MCP** connection (Full or Dev seat) for the design-to-code workflow
- View/Dev access to the source Figma file you're implementing

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/plugin87/shadcn-figma-starter-batch2.git
cd shadcn-figma-starter-batch2

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install            # or: pnpm install / bun install

# 3. Verify the shadcn project context (run this before any code change)
npx shadcn@latest info --json

# 4. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> and replace `app/page.tsx` with your first screen.

> To render exactly like Figma, also install the fonts the kit declares — see [Fonts](#fonts).

## How to use

### Is there a plugin / skill / command to install?

| Thing | What it is | Do you install it? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`shadcn-ui-tailwind-figma` skill** | The fidelity workflow at `.claude/skills/.../SKILL.md` | **No** — it ships in this repo and **auto-loads** when the task involves shadcn, Tailwind, or Figma. You don't call it. |
| **Figma MCP server** | Bridges Figma ↔ your agent (`get_design_context`, `get_screenshot`, `get_variable_defs`) | **Yes, once** — connect Figma's Dev Mode MCP server (or the Figma connector in Claude). This is the only required external piece. |
| **shadcn CLI** | `npx shadcn@latest …` — adds components, reports project context | No install — run via `npx` on demand |
| **Slash command** | — | **None ship in this repo.** You drive it with a normal prompt + a Figma link. |

### The core loop

1. **Open the project** in an Agent-Skill tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, …).
2. **Connect a Figma MCP server** and make sure you have view/Dev access to the file.
3. **Give the agent a Figma node + an instruction.** Paste the Figma URL (or select the node in Figma) and ask in plain language. The skill auto-applies the 6-step workflow → installs any missing components via the shadcn CLI → validates against the screenshot.
4. **Review** the inventory and the result; answer any "stop and ask" questions.

### Example prompts

```text
Implement this Figma frame as a React component:
https://www.figma.com/design/<fileKey>/<file>?node-id=123-456

Build the login screen from the selected Figma node, 1:1, dark mode included.

Add the Button variants from this Figma page and wire them with shadcn.

Re-sync design tokens from the Figma kit and update globals.css + DESIGN.md.
```

You do **not** type a command or skill name — just describe the task and include the Figma reference. The agent will:

```bash
# what the skill makes the agent run, in order
npx shadcn@latest info --json          # project context (always first)
# → get_design_context / get_screenshot / get_variable_defs  (Figma MCP)
# → writes an inventory, then the JSX
npx shadcn@latest add <component>      # only what the design needs
npm run dev                            # verify visually
```

### Tips

- **Always let it run `npx shadcn@latest info --json` first** — wrong context = wrong imports.
- **Give the most specific node** (a component/frame, not a whole page) for accurate `get_variable_defs`.
- If Figma access fails, the agent runs `whoami` — share the file with that account.
- Want to change the look? Don't preset-swap — re-export the kit (see [Theming](#theming)).

## Design tokens

Three-tier model (full detail in [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md)):

```
Tier 1  Primitives   raw Tailwind-palette sRGB (neutral/900, blue/9, …)
Tier 2  Semantic      --primary, --background, …   (:root / .dark)
Tier 3  Utilities     bg-primary, text-muted-foreground   (@theme inline)
```

Components only ever touch **Tier 3**. The same three tiers exist as Figma collections, so Tier 2 names match 1:1 across design and code — `get_variable_defs` returns `primary`, you write `bg-primary`, no translation.

| Category | Source | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Color | kit `shadcn/ui` collection | 31 standard + 4 kit-specific tokens, exact sRGB, light + dark |
| Radius | Tailwind v4 static scale | `rounded-xs…4xl` = 2/4/6/8/12/16/24/32px; `--radius` = `0.5rem` |
| Typography | Tailwind v4 + kit `family/*` | full size/weight/tracking/leading scale; Inter / Geist Mono |
| Spacing | Tailwind v4 (`--spacing` 0.25rem) | every `p-/m-/gap-/size-*` = `n × 4px` |
| Shadow | Tailwind v4 + kit override | `shadow-xs` = 10% (kit); rest = Tailwind default |
| Border | Tailwind v4 = kit | `0 / 1 / 2 / 4 / 8` px, color from `--border` |

> **Rule:** values are kit-synced and verified 1:1 against the Figma export. Never hand-edit a value or substitute a color — re-export from Figma and regenerate. See [`DESIGN.md` §2](./DESIGN.md).

## Figma → Code workflow

Enforced by [`.claude/skills/shadcn-ui-tailwind-figma/SKILL.md`](./.claude/skills/shadcn-ui-tailwind-figma/SKILL.md). The **Fidelity Contract**: no adding, no removing, no inferring, no polishing.

1. **`get_design_context`** — structured React + Tailwind + Code Connect for the node
2. **`get_screenshot`** — the visual source of truth
3. **`get_variable_defs`** — the design tokens used (by Figma variable name)
4. **Inventory** — write a literal list of everything in the node *before* any JSX
5. **Implement** against the inventory — reuse shadcn components, map tokens 1:1
6. **Validate** against the screenshot — walk the inventory item by item

**Stop and ask** (don't guess) when: a variable resolves to a value not in the tokens; a referenced component isn't installed/known; screenshot and context disagree; a behavioral state isn't shown; sample data is placeholder; copy is in an unshipped language. The full list is in the skill.

## Fonts

Fonts are **data-driven from the Figma file's `family/*` token** — not a fixed project default. This kit resolves to:

| Variable | Stack | Figma token |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--font-sans` | `"Inter", ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif` | `family/sans` = Inter |
| `--font-mono` | `"Geist Mono", ui-monospace, monospace` | `family/mono` = Geist Mono |

These are declared in `globals.css` but the font files are **not bundled**. To render exactly like Figma, install them — e.g. via `next/font`:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { Inter } from "next/font/google"
const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"], variable: "--font-sans" })
// add `${inter.variable}` to <html className>
```

…or through the shadcn font registry (see [`DESIGN.md` §4](./DESIGN.md)). For Thai projects, append a Thai sans (IBM Plex Sans Thai, Noto Sans Thai) to the `--font-sans` stack. **If your Figma file uses different fonts, regenerate `--font-*` from its token — don't hardcode.**

## Theming

Tokens live in `app/globals.css` only (`:root` light, `.dark` dark), synced **1:1 from the Figma kit** (exact sRGB).

- **Re-theme** — re-export the Figma `shadcn/ui` collection and regenerate `globals.css`. **Do not** run `npx shadcn@latest apply --preset`; it overwrites kit-synced values and causes drift (see `DESIGN.md` §2.5).
- **One token** — edit `globals.css`, then update the matching Figma variable in the same change.
- **New custom token** — define under `:root` + `.dark`, register in `@theme inline`, add the variable to Figma (both modes). Use sRGB hex, not OKLCH (see `DESIGN.md` §9).

> Never create a new CSS file — always edit `globals.css`.

## Dark mode

Class-based: add `.dark` to `<html>`. Semantic tokens auto-switch — **never** write `dark:` color overrides.

```tsx
// ✅ correct
<div className="bg-background text-foreground" />
// ❌ wrong
<div className="bg-white text-black dark:bg-gray-950 dark:text-white" />
```

To wire a toggle, add `next-themes` (not pre-installed):

```bash
npm install next-themes
```

```tsx
<ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="system" enableSystem>
  {children}
</ThemeProvider>
```

## AI agent configuration

| File | Read by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code | Project rules, hard constraints, must-read order |
| `AGENTS.md` | Cursor, Copilot, other agents | Universal equivalent of `CLAUDE.md` |
| `.claude/skills/.../SKILL.md` | Any Agent-Skill tool | The strict Figma-fidelity workflow (auto-loaded on relevant tasks) |
| `DESIGN.md` | Humans + agents | Token reference + composition rules |

The skill triggers automatically when working with shadcn components, Tailwind classes, or Figma nodes — its full instructions load into context only when needed.

## Scripts

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server (<http://localhost:3000>) |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run start` | Serve the production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint (`next lint`) |
| `npx shadcn@latest info --json` | Inspect project context — **run before any code change** |
| `npx shadcn@latest search <q>` | Search the registry before building custom UI |
| `npx shadcn@latest add <name>` | Add a component (`--dry-run` / `--diff` to preview) |

## Git workflow

```
main   ← stable, mirrors what's shipped
  ▲ fast-forward / PR
dev    ← active work; commit here, then merge to main
```

Work on `dev`, commit, push, then merge into `main` in rounds:

```bash
git checkout dev
# …changes…
git commit -m "…" && git push origin dev
git checkout main && git merge dev && git push origin main
```

## FAQ

**Will every developer/student produce the same result?**
The *visual output* converges tightly: tokens are fixed and kit-synced, and the skill forbids adding/removing/inferring/polishing — so colors, spacing, radius, and type are identical. The *code structure* (JSX shape, class order, which components are installed) will vary, because LLM codegen isn't deterministic. Grade/measure on **fidelity to Figma + rule adherence**, not byte-identical code.

**Why no example components?**
shadcn/ui components are source you own. Pre-bundling them rots; installing on demand keeps them current and matched to the design.

**Why sync from Figma instead of `apply --preset`?**
A preset overwrites token values with shadcn defaults, breaking the 1:1 match with the source design. The kit is the source of truth.

**Tokens look like raw hex, not OKLCH — is that intentional?**
Yes. Values are the kit's exact sRGB output so code is byte-identical to Figma. Convert to OKLCH only at high precision if you must.

## What this starter does NOT include

By design, to stay minimal — add when the design calls for it, not before:

- No example components or pages — install via `npx shadcn@latest add`
- No authentication, routing helpers, or middleware
- No Storybook, testing setup, or CI config
- No theme toggle pre-installed (add `next-themes` when needed)
- No bundled font files — declared per the Figma token; install to match (see [Fonts](#fonts))
- No `tailwind.config.ts` — Tailwind v4 uses `@theme inline` in `globals.css` only
- No license file — add one before distributing
